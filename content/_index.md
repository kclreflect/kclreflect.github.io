### reflect - **an epsrc iaa project exploring the impact of wearable data on personalised decision support**

&nbsp;  

### about

The [epsrc consult](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/P010105/1) project developed a [decision-support system](https://kclhi.org/consult/demo/?a=UGU2YmFxRUQ6dWtlN2JQRXk=) characterised by its integration of computational argumentation (a form of AI) with wearable device data.

reflect is an [epsrc iaa project](https://epsrc.ukri.org/innovation/fundingforimpact/impact-acceleration-accounts/) that aims to generalise the wearable device logic developed within consult, in order to support other decision support systems.

In doing so, the impact of wearable data on the operation of these systems, and thus on patient healthcare, can be further explored.
